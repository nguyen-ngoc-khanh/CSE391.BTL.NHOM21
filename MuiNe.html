                            Mui Ne is inherently the name of a cape protruding into the sea, the name of a sea cape in Phan Thiet city, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam. This is a famous tourist center of Binh Thuan province and one of the national tourist areas of Vietnam 198km from Ho Chi Minh City. Population 1,180,300 (2011 estimate),
                            <br>
                            The name Mui Ne comes from the fact that fishermen often come here when they encounter a storm when they go to sea to take refuge. “Nose” is the headland leading to the great sea; “Dodge” means to dodge, escape the storm. This place has a harmony between the yellow color of fine sand, the iridescent color of the sun and the deep blue of the sea, creating a feeling of warmth and freshness.
                            <br>
                            Located 22km northeast of Phan Thiet city, Mui Ne (Binh Thuan) is one of the most beautiful beaches in Southeast Asia with a clear blue sea and wide sand dunes.
                            <br>
                            Not only famous for its white sand dunes, Mui Ne also impresses visitors by the lush green coconut groves stretching along the coast in an arc. The tall coconut trees, falling to the shore, create a poetic scene for Mui Ne beach.

                            The heaviest rain falls around June and July. However, this place is said to have the lowest rainfall in the country, so the rains are usually small and stop quickly.
                            <br>
                            The dry season in Mui Ne is usually pleasant and sunny. The hottest month falls in April, May, the peak is about 29-30°C.

                        </a>
                        <p>Squid teeth are actually small round meat, located right at the mouth of the squid. It feels chewy when eating. Squid teeth are often chosen as an appetizer when you go to eat at specialty restaurants in Mui Ne.</p>

                        <p>Banh Beo cup is a simple breakfast dish for local people. The taste of Banh Beo here is very different from Hue’s banh beo because of its sweeter taste. The cake is served with green beans, shrimp meat, fat, fish sauce, tomato sauce, and crushed peanuts to create a rich, eye-catching red color.</p>

                        <p>Mui Ne soup cake has a sweeter taste than fish cake soup in other places like Nha Trang, Da Nang,… Visitors can also enjoy it with bread to eat with the broth, which is also very strange.</p>

                        <p>Unlike the fried Banh Quai in the North, the banh quai cauldron in Mui Ne is steamed. The transparent skin of the cake can clearly see the shrimp meat, green beans inside. The cake is served with lightly mixed fish sauce with onion fat, which is quite delicious. Eating about 5-7 pieces at a time is enough to fill you up for the afternoon.</p>

                                <p>Even though it’s at the sea, it gets dark very quickly. By 4 o’clock, it’s no longer sunny, so if you want to take pictures in the sun, you have to go early.</p>

                                <p>Renting a jeep is more fun and cheaper. And it is recommended to take a jeep because the road is also quite far, it will be tiring to ride a motorbike.</p>

                                <p>Restaurants, hotels, and resorts are all on Nguyen Dinh Chieu Street, but this road is quite long, so you need a motorbike to move around.</p>

                                <p>If you want to visit the Sand Dunes, the most suitable time is from 7-8 am when the temperature is only from 25 – 27 degrees Celsius. At this time, the sand dunes have not been heated so you can comfortably walk barefoot. Walk on the sand to see the beauty of Mui Ne.</p>
                            </li>

                                    If your purpose of coming to Mui Ne is mainly for swimming, you should note that you should not swim in July and August because this time seaweed thrives, the seawater is likely to be polluted by algae and cloudy. , has the potential to cause skin allergies

                                    I hope the above sharing will help you have an enjoyable trip. Mui Ne is one of the great tourist destinations combining the blue sea and golden sand, which brings a wild beauty for you to explore. This will be one of the great options for you to explore this summer.

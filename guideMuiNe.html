                Mui Ne is inherently the name of a cape protruding into the sea, the name of a sea cape in Phan Thiet city, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam. This is a famous tourist center of Binh Thuan province and one of the national tourist areas of Vietnam 198km from Ho Chi Minh City. Population 1,180,300 (2011 estimate),
                <br>
                The name Mui Ne comes from the fact that fishermen often come here when they encounter a storm when they go to sea to take refuge. “Nose” is the headland leading to the great sea; “Dodge” means to dodge, escape the storm. This place has a harmony between the yellow color of fine sand, the iridescent color of the sun and the deep blue of the sea, creating a feeling of warmth and freshness.
                <br>
                Located 22km northeast of Phan Thiet city, Mui Ne (Binh Thuan) is one of the most beautiful beaches in Southeast Asia with a clear blue sea and wide sand dunes.
                <br>
                Not only famous for its white sand dunes, Mui Ne also impresses visitors by the lush green coconut groves stretching along the coast in an arc. The tall coconut trees, falling to the shore, create a poetic scene for Mui Ne beach.
            </p>
    
            <h2 id="Mui_Nes_Weather_-_When_to_go">Mui Ne’s Weather – When to go?</h2>
            <p>
                A year is divided into 2 seasons: dry season and rainy season.
                <br>
                The heaviest rain falls around June and July. However, this place is said to have the lowest rainfall in the country, so the rains are usually small and stop quickly.
                <br>
                The dry season in Mui Ne is usually pleasant and sunny. The hottest month falls in April, May, the peak is about 29-30°C.
                <br>
                Mui Ne’s climate is mild and pleasant, all four seasons can be visited, and rain is not a big obstacle.
            </p>
    
            <h3 id="1_From_December_to_Februaryy">1. From December to February</h3>
            <p>The weather is a bit chilly, making the scene even more poetic. Visitors can come to play sandboarding or watch the sunset gradually descend behind the colorful sand dunes. This is also the occasion when the lotus flowers in Bau Trang bloom simultaneously, creating a wonderful picture of nature with pink lotus, clear lake and immense white sand.</p>
    
            <h3 id="2_August_to_December">2. August to December</h3>
            <p>It’s time for wave lovers. If the summer waves are quiet and tasteless, this season the waves are joyful, youthful again, undulating just enough but not too strong. Those who love surfing, canoeing and swimming activities should travel to Mui Ne from August to December.</p>
    
            <h3 id="3_The_end_April_to_early_July">3. The end April to early July 7</h3>
            <p>
                The hottest time of the year in Mui Ne is from the end of April to the beginning of July. Although the sun is hot, this is the time when Mui Ne welcomes the most tourists because, in the midst of the sweltering summer day, everyone wants to immerse themselves in the cool seawater. Therefore, summer is the peak season for beach tourism in general, not just Mui Ne.
                <br>
                Mui Ne each season has a different look, each time has a different nuance.

                <br>
                Some experiences when traveling to Mui Ne.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Even though it’s at the sea, it gets dark very quickly. By 4 o’clock, it’s no longer sunny, so if you want to take pictures in the sun, you have to go early.</li>
                <li>Renting a jeep is more fun and cheaper. And it is recommended to take a jeep because the road is also quite far, it will be tiring to ride a motorbike.</li>
                <li>If you want to take pictures of the sea, you should go early before 11 am because the sand beach will be wider and cleaner.</li>
                <li>It is better to book a room directly at the hotel, the price will be cheaper.</li>
                <li>Restaurants, hotels, and resorts are all on Nguyen Dinh Chieu Street, but this road is quite long, so you need a motorbike to move around.</li>
                <li>If you want to visit the Sand Dunes, the most suitable time is from 7-8 am when the temperature is only from 25 – 27 degrees Celsius. At this time, the sand dunes have not been heated so you can comfortably walk barefoot. Walk on the sand to see the beauty of Mui Ne.</li>
                <li>If your purpose of coming to Mui Ne is mainly for swimming, you should note that you should not swim in July and August because this time seaweed thrives, the seawater is likely to be polluted by algae and cloudy. , has the potential to cause skin allergies </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope the above sharing will help you have an enjoyable trip. Mui Ne is one of the great tourist destinations combining the blue sea and golden sand, which brings a wild beauty for you to explore. This will be one of the great options for you to explore this summer.</p>
